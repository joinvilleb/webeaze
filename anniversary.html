  <h1>We've turned 1 ðŸŽ‰</h1>
  <p> Today, October 1, WebEaze turns one year old. We started our business as Billy Joinville Web Services on October 1, 2024, and rebranded to WebEaze on March 1, 2025.  </p>

  <p>
    Billy Joinville Web Services was created to help small businesses establish an online presence with professional websites and ongoing support. Over the past year, we've had the privilege of working with amazing clients (43 now) and helping them grow their businesses online. 
  </p>

  <p>
    We've learned a lot in our first year, and we're excited to continue growing and evolving for years to come. Your support has been invaluable, and we can't wait to see what the future holds.
  </p>



    
    
    
    <p>
      To mark this milestone, we're launching a special referral program for the month of October.
    </p>

  
  <h2>For This Month Only:</h2>
  <p><span class="highlight">$200 for every referral</span> that becomes a WebEaze client.<br>
     No limits. More referrals = more rewards.</p>
  
  <a href="https://webeaze.tawk.help/article/referral" class="btn btn-custom">Refer Someone Now</a>
  
  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>1. Tell a friend, colleague, or business owner about WebEaze.<br>
     2. If they sign up, you get <span class="highlight">$200 cash</span> straight to you.<br>
     3. They get a professional website + ongoing support. Everybody wins.</p>
  
  <p>Offer valid only through <span class="highlight">October 31</span>. Don't miss out!</p>

  <h3>Thank you for being part of our journey. Here's to many more years of success together!</h3>
