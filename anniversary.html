  <h1>We've turned 1 ðŸŽ‰</h1>
  <p> Today, October 1, WebEaze turns one year old. We started our business as Billy Joinville Web Services on October 1, 2024, and rebranded to WebEaze on March 1, 2025.  </p>

  <p>
    Billy Joinville Web Services was created to help small businesses establish an online presence with professional websites and ongoing support. Over the past year, we've had the privilege of working with amazing clients (43 now) and helping them grow their businesses online. 
  </p>

  <p>
    We've learned a lot in our first year, and we're excited to continue growing and evolving for years to come. Your support has been invaluable, and we can't wait to see what the future holds.

    <div class="spoiler-content" style="display: none; text-align: left;">
        <p>
            1. Tax Responsibility: All referral earnings are considered taxable income. You're solely responsible for reporting any earnings to your tax authority. WebEaze does not withhold taxes or provide tax documents unless legally required.
        </p>

        <p>
            2. Payout Eligibility: Payouts are issued only after the referred client successfully completes payment and remains an active client for at least 7 days from the start of the subscription. We reserve the right to cancel payouts for refunded or disputed transactions. 
        </p>

        <p>
            3. No Referral Limits: There is no limit to how many qualified referrals you can make or how many payouts you can earn. However, WebEaze reserves the right to review and deny payouts if referrals appear to be fraudulent, self-referred, or violate the intent of the program.
        </p>

        <p>
            4. Verification: You must utilize the contact form to inform WebEaze of a referral. Referrals from both parties must mention the name or business at the time of signup to qualify. We're not responsible for untracked or unverifiable referrals.
        </p>

        <p>
            5. Payment Methods: Payouts are issued via Venmo, Cash App, PayPal, or Zelle only.

We will not ask for information beyond your account username or your phone number.
        </p>
